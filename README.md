# Simple Arduino RGB controller
Program used to control an RGB led strip, mounted on a 3D printer

## Hardware used
	- 12V RGB led strip
	- Arduino Uno
	- 3 MOSFET transistors to control the led strip
	- PCB to sold components on
	- Arduino Uno support printed, model from thingiverse
	- PCB support printed, model from thingiverse
	- 24V to 12V DC - DC converter, because the printer power supply deliver 24V.
